"MRSC - Marine Science","MRSC","515","Structure and Function in Marine Animals","This course will use marine invertebrates and vertebrates to explore the structural plans of animals in a functional framework. Rather than providing a comprehensive survey of diversity in the animal kingdom, specific taxa will be chosen that exemplify specific systems (e.g., respiratory, skeletal, nervous, etc.). The major taxa will be discussed together with minor groups that have peculiarities that are of general biological importance. This course will combine the disciplines of classification, evolution, morphology, biomechanics, physiology and biochemistry. The emphasis placed on each discipline will depend on the interests of the instructor. Field work will be integrated with the laboratory exercises.
